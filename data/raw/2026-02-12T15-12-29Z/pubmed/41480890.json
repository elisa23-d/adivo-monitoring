  "abstract": "This Letter to the Editor provides a constructive methodological commentary on the recently published article \"Real-world efficacy and retention of guselkumab in psoriatic arthritis.\" We address issues related to the completers-only analysis, interpretation of axial domain outcomes, and absence of standardized response criteria such as ASAS20/40. Recommendations are proposed to improve the validity and comparability of real-world studies in psoriatic arthritis, with emphasis on axial disease assessment and time-to-event modeling.",
