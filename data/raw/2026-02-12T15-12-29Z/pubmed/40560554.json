  "title": "Guselkumab for Moderate to Severe Scalp Psoriasis Across All Skin Tones: Cohort B of the VISIBLE Randomized Clinical Trial.",
  "abstract": "Varying hair textures and hair care practices contribute to nuances in clinical presentation and management of scalp psoriasis across diverse patient populations. Cohort B of the VISIBLE trial enrolled participants with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis and skin of color, across the skin-tone spectrum.\nTo evaluate efficacy, quality of life, and adverse event outcomes of guselkumab, 100 mg, among participants with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis and skin of color over 48 weeks.\nThis ongoing phase 3b, randomized clinical trial at 45 sites in the US and Canada enrolled adults with skin of color and moderate to severe scalp psoriasis (scalp surface area [SSA] ≥30%; Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index [PSSI] ≥12; scalp-specific Investigator's Global Assessment [ss-IGA] score ≥3; ≥1 nonscalp plaque). Data were collected from September 2022 to June 2024.\nRandomized participants (3:1) received guselkumab, 100 mg, at weeks 0, 4, and every 8 weeks, or placebo at weeks 0, 4, and 12, then guselkumab at weeks 16, 20, and every 8 weeks.\nCoprimary end points were ss-IGA score of 0 or 1 (ss-IGA 0/1) and 90% or greater improvement in PSSI (PSSI 90) at week 16 (guselkumab vs placebo). Major secondary end points included ss-IGA 0 (complete scalp clearance), PSSI 100, percentage changes from baseline in PSSI and SSA, changes from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary (PSSD) symptoms score, and 4-point or greater reduction in Scalp Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score.\nOf 108 participants (81 randomized to guselkumab; 27 randomized to placebo), 100 (92.6%) completed 48 weeks of treatment. The mean (SD) age overall was 42.5 (13.6) years, and 58 participants (56.9%) were male. At the week 16 primary end point, in the guselkumab (n = 76) vs placebo (n = 26) groups, respectively, response rates were as follows: ss-IGA 0/1, 68.4% (n = 52) vs 11.5% (n = 3) (P < .001); PSSI 90, 65.8% (n = 50) vs 3.8% (n = 1) (P < .001); ss-IGA 0, 57.9% (n = 44) vs 3.8% (n = 1) (P < .001); PSSI 100, 59.2% (n = 45) vs 3.8% (n = 1) (P < .001); 4-point or greater reduction in Scalp Itch NRS score (in those with a baseline score of at least 4), 69.4% (n = 50 of 72) vs 24.0% (n = 6 of 25) (P < .001). Guselkumab efficacy increased and was maintained through week 48, when guselkumab-randomized participants achieved mean (SD) percentage improvements in PSSI and SSA of 94.6% (12.2%) and 94.8% (16.2%), respectively, and 51 (67.1%) achieved ss-IGA 0. DLQI and PSSD symptoms score least-squares mean changes were -9.7 (95% CI, -11.1 to -8.2) vs -2.2 (95% CI, -4.8 to 0.4) (P < .001) and -44.8 (95% CI, -50.6 to -39.1) vs -8.3 (95% CI, -18.4 to 1.9) (P < .001), respectively, with sustained improvements through week 48. Through week 16, infections were the most common adverse events in the guselkumab (n = 12; 14.8%) and placebo (n = 1; 3.7%) groups.\nIn this randomized clinical trial, after 3 doses of guselkumab, most participants achieved significant scalp clearance and clinically meaningful quality-of-life improvements; improvements increased and were maintained through week 48.\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05272150.",
