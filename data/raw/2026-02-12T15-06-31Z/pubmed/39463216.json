  "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, and irritant contact dermatitis comprise a large proportion of chronic inflammatory dermatoses. This paper reviews the clinical presentations, pathophysiology, and therapeutics of inflammatory dermatoses, highlighting recent drug developments such as lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis as well as deucravacitinib and spesolimab for psoriasis. Chronic inflammatory dermatoses significantly impact patient quality of life and contribute to substantial healthcare costs. Effective management of severe cases often requires systemic therapies and biological therapies. A thorough clinical evaluation with a tailored therapeutic approach is essential for delivering optimal care to individuals with chronic inflammatory skin diseases.",
