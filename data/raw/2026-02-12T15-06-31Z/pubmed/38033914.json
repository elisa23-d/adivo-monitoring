  "title": "Rapid hair regrowth in an alopecia universalis patient with deucravacitinib: A case report.",
  "abstract": "Alopecia universalis is a severe, difficult to treat variant of alopecia areata that results in loss of hair on the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, and extremities. Deucravacitinib, a selective TYK2 inhibitor, has been recently approved in Canada, opening the door to novel uses of the drug. We present the case of a patient known for psoriasis who developed alopecia universalis resistant to many interventions (topical minoxidil and topical, intralesional, and systemic corticosteroids). We report the first case of successful rapid hair regrowth after starting deucravacitinib, which should prompt further inquiry into the use of TYK2 inhibitors in the management of alopecia areata.",
