  "title": "Safety and efficacy of Deucravacitinib for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis: A meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "To systematically evaluate the safety and efficacy of Deucravacitinib for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Deucravacitinib for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science were searched from database establishment to April 2023. Literature quality was independently evaluated by two investigators using the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool, and the systematic analysis was made using StateSE15 and RevMan 5.3 software.\nFour RCTs were included, including 1751 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Meta-analysis showed that the differences in efficacy and adverse events (AEs) between the Deucravacitinib group and placebo group were significant (p < 0.05). The patients in the Deucravacitinib group took orally 3-12 mg daily for 12 sequential weeks or 6 mg daily for 52 sequential weeks. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) reduced by 75% (PASI 75), (PASI 90), and (PASI 100), static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) of 0 or 1 (sPGA 0/1), Dermatology Life Quality Index of 0 or 1 (DLQI 0/1), and Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary (PSSD) were significantly higher in the Deucravacitinib group compared to the placebo group, with significant differences (p < 0.05). The most frequently encountered AEs after treatment in the Deucravacitinib group was nasopharyngitis.\nOral administration of Deucravacitinib is effective for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Attention should be paid to the occurrence of AEs, and more RCTs are required to evaluate the relationship between the dose and safety and efficacy.",
