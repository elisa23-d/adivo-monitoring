  "title": "Dramatic clearance of extensive psoriasis in a pediatric patient treated with upadacitinib: A case report.",
  "abstract": "We present a unique case of an 8-year-old boy with severe, treatment-refractory palmoplantar psoriasis and genital involvement, unresponsive to nine systemic agents, including multiple biologics and TYK2 inhibition with deucravacitinib. Following years of debilitating symptoms and functional impairment, he achieved near-complete resolution within 2 weeks of initiating upadacitinib monotherapy. This dramatic and sustained response highlights the potential role of JAK1 inhibition in modulating complex inflammatory pathways in pediatric psoriasis, particularly in challenging anatomic sites and refractory cases.",
