  "title": "Male and female pattern hair loss.",
  "abstract": "Androgenetic alopecia, commonly referred to as male or female pattern hair loss, is a prevalent condition encountered in clinical practice. It is important to identify potential underlying causes and differentiate it from other forms of hair loss, which may require referral to a dermatologist for management. Pharmacological treatments for female pattern hair loss include minoxidil (topical and oral) and antiandrogens such as spironolactone. For male pattern hair loss, minoxidil and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (e.g. finasteride, dutasteride) can be used. Combination therapy is commonly employed, with clinical improvement typically requiring a minimum of 6 months. Supplements and other treatments have varying levels of evidence, and counselling is important to help patients make informed decisions about their management.",
