  "title": "A systematic review of the efficacy of TYK2 inhibitors in patients with dermatological disease.",
  "abstract": "This study systematically reviews existing data on the efficacy of Tyrosine Kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitors in comparison to placebo or standard treatments for therapeutic benefit and improving quality of life in dermatological diseases. Seventeen records representing 13 clinical trials, one matching-adjusted indirect comparison, and one case study were included. Results indicate that Deucravacitinib is superior to placebo, Apremilast and Adalimumab in treating adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and superior to placebo in the treatment of adults with systemic lupus erythematosus. Comparative investigations on Brepocitinib and Ropsacitinib were more limited. Oral Brepocitinib demonstrated superiority over placebo in managing alopecia areata, and hidradenitis suppurativa. Topical Brepocitinib exhibited superiority over placebo in treating atopic dermatitis, but not plaque psoriasis. Ropsacitinib demonstrated superiority over placebo in the management of plaque psoriasis. Brepocitinib and Ropsacitinib had more side effects than Deucravacitinib.",
