  "abstract": "Despite numerous effective biologics for treating psoriasis, new treatments continue to be investigated due to an unmet need for certain patient populations. This review discusses therapies that were recently Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for treating psoriasis, including the topical agents tapinarof and roflumilast, deucravacitinib, an oral small molecule that selectively inhibits tyrosine kinase 2, and spesolimab, a monoclonal antibody inhibiting interleukin-36 that became the first FDA-approved treatment for generalized pustular psoriasis flares. Other therapies are in the pipeline, such as orismilast, as well as Mind.Px, a tool for predicting biological response, is also highlighted.",
