  "title": "First Use of Combination Oral Deucravacitinib With Tapinarof Cream for Treatment of Severe Plaque Psoriasis.",
  "abstract": "Plaque psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated, cutaneous, and systemic inflammatory dermatosis. Its pathogenesis involves the dysregulation of the interleukin (IL)-23/IL-17 signaling pathway. There are a range of treatment options available, encompassing topical agents, biologics, oral systemic therapy, and phototherapy. The utility of combination treatment has also been described and is a budding field of research. Here we describe the first case of adult severe generalized plaque psoriasis treated with once-daily oral deucravacitinib 6 mg combined with tapinarof cream 1% applied once daily. To our knowledge, the combination of these agents has not yet been described in the literature. J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(3):&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;doi:10.36849/JDD.8091.",
