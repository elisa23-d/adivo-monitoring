  "title": "Deucravacitinib, a selective tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.",
  "abstract": "Protein kinases play a crucial role in intracellular signaling pathways that lead to inflammation and cell proliferation. New understandings of the involvement of these metabolic pathways in the pathogenesis of psoriasis allowed the development of a new class of drugs. Unlike biologics, these compounds work by blocking intracellular targets involved in the immune response.\nDeucravacitinib is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of TYK2 that binds the pseudokinase domain and locks the kinase in an inactive state by an allosteric mechanism, arresting TYK2-mediated signaling cascades and disabling the upregulation of proinflammatory genes implicated in psoriasis. The authors present the results of phase I-III clinical trials of deucravacitinib for the treatment of psoriasis.\nAt week 16 about 56% of the patients treated with deucravacitinib achieved PASI75. No serious infections were reported, nor were thromboembolic events or laboratory abnormalities. Efficacy was reported to be persistent and safety profiles were shown to be consistent for up to 2 years. Deucravacitinib can potentially become a safe, effective, well-tolerated treatment for patients suffering from moderate-to-severe disease. Future studies and real-life experiences will be important to determine the exact role of this drug in the treatment of psoriasis.",
