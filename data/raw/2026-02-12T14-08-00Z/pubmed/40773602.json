  "abstract": "To assess the effectiveness, safety, and quality of life in patients who received topical calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate (C/BD) foam added to oral deucravacitinib for treating moderate to severe, chronic plaque psoriasis.\nIn this prospective, open-label, single-center study, adults (&ge;18 years of age) with psoriasis (physician global assessment [PGA] &ge;3, body surface area [BSA] &ge;10%, and psoriasis area severity index [PASI] &ge;12) took deucravacitinib (6 mg daily) for 8 weeks. At week 8, patients who achieved PASI 75 continued on deucravacitinib alone up to week 24; PASI 25-74 used daily, C/BD for 4 weeks; and &lt;PASI 25 were discontinued. The final follow up was week 24.\nOf 30 enrolled patients (mean age 45.4 years; 63% male), 18 completed. By week 8, 5 achieved PASI 75, 20 PASI 25-74, and 3 PASI &lt;25; and 2 discontinued for other reasons. Mean scores for PASI, PGA, BSA, and dermatology life quality index (DLQI) in patients with PASI 24-75 at week 8 improved by 83%, 52%, 78%, and 74%, respectively, from baseline with 4 weeks of C/BD add-on therapy (week 12); improvements were maintained up to week 24. Few patients experienced adverse events (AEs), and none had serious AEs or discontinued due to AEs.",
