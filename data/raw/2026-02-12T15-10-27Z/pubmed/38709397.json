  "title": "Management of Psoriasis Patients with Serious Infectious Diseases.",
  "abstract": "The management of patients affected by moderate-to-severe psoriasis may be challenging, in particular in patients with serious infectious diseases [tuberculosis (TB), hepatitis B and C, HIV, COVID-19]. Indeed, these infections should be ruled out before starting and during systemic treatment for psoriasis. Currently, four conventional systemic drugs (methotrexate, dimethyl fumarate, acitretin, cyclosporine), four classes of biologics (anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha, anti-interleukin (IL)12/23, anti-IL-17s, and anti-IL-23], and two oral small molecules (apremilast, deucravacitinib) have been licensed for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Each of these drugs is characterized by a unique safety profile which should be considered before starting therapy. Indeed, some comorbidities or risk factors may limit their use. In this context, the aim of this manuscript was to evaluate the management of patients affected by moderate-to-severe psoriasis with serious infectious diseases.",
