  "title": "Outcomes of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and PASI components in two phase III trials of deucravacitinib in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.",
  "abstract": "Deucravacitinib was significantly more effective than placebo in the 52-week, phase III POETYK PSO-1 and PSO-2 trials. This study further evaluated deucravacitinib efficacy compared with placebo in these trials based on Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) outcomes. Patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis received placebo or deucravacitinib 6 mg once daily. At week 16, patients crossed over from placebo to deucravacitinib. Patients treated with deucravacitinib had greater reductions from baseline in PASI within 1 week, with higher improvements observed compared with placebo at week 16. Patients who crossed over to deucravacitinib at week 16 achieved similar improvements at week 52 as patients treated continuously with deucravacitinib from day 1. Significantly higher proportions of patients treated with deucravacitinib achieved treat-to-target PASI thresholds (≤ 1, ≤ 2, ≤ 3, ≤ 4, ≤ 5), and significantly greater improvements were observed in each PASI component (body region: head, trunk, upper/lower extremities; plaque characteristics: erythema, induration, desquamation) compared with placebo at week 16.",
