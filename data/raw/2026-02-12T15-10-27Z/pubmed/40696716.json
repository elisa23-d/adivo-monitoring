  "title": "Synthesis of Radiolabeled and Stable-Isotope Labeled Deucravacitinib (BMS-986165).",
  "abstract": "Deucravacitinib (BMS-986165) is a small molecule allosteric inhibitor of tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) currently approved for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) is a member of the Janus (JAK) family of non-receptor kinases that modulate the production of inflammatory cytokines. The synthesis of 14C-radiolabeled and stable-isotope labeled variants of deucravacitinib is described in this publication.",
