  "abstract": "Deucravacitinib is a novel oral selective tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor used to treat plaque psoriasis. The most common cutaneous adverse effects are acne and folliculitis. We present a series of seven patients with prototypical papulopustular rosacea (PPR) following commencement of deucravacitinib. Although most of our patients demonstrated improvement in psoriasis on deucravacitinib, all seven patients discontinued therapy because of the severity and impact of PPR. Rosacea can be a severe adverse effect of deucravacitinib, impacting tolerability and influencing future treatment options.",
